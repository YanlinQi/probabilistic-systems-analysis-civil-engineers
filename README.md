# Probabilistic Systems Analysis for Civil Engineers

This repository contains the materials for the "Probabilistic Systems Analysis for Civil Engineers" course taught at UC Davis. The course focuses on applying probabilistic methods and statistical analysis to civil engineering problems.

## Course Description

This course introduces the students to principles of probability and statistics with applications to life in general and engineering in particular. The course works through the principles of probability and their mathematical representation in the form of variables, relationships, and functions. The lectures will cover the methods of statistical analysis of engineering experimental and field data.  There will be a mixture of theory and practice.

## Course Topics

1. **Introduction**
   - What is statistics? Statistical measures.
   
2. **Probability**
   - Definition of probability, sample space and events, experiments with equally-likely outcomes, conditional probability. Bayesâ€™ theorem.
   
3. **Discrete Random Variables**
   - Random variables, distribution and probability mass functions, expectation, mean and variance, binomial distribution, negative binomial distribution, geometric distribution, hypergeometric distribution, Poisson distribution.
   
4. **Continuous Random Variables**
   - Probability density function, uniform distribution, normal distribution, exponential distribution, chi-squared distribution.
   
5. **Joint Distributions**
   - Mean, covariance, and correlation for two random variables considered together, mean and variance of a linear combination of random variables.
   
6. **Sampling Distributions**
   - Sampling and sampling distributions, sampling distributions of means and sums, the Central Limit Theorem.
   
7. **Estimation**
   - Estimators, unbiasedness, efficiency, consistency, estimation of a population mean, maximum likelihood estimation, confidence intervals.
   
8. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Statistical tests of hypotheses, null and alternative hypotheses, tests about the population mean, tests about the difference between two population means, tests about the population variance, goodness-of-fit tests, empirical examples.
   
9. **Regression Analysis**
